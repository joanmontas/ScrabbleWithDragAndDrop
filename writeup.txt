#Extra Credit
    Validating to see if a word that the user enters is valid.
    The user is presented with a toast indicating if valid or not.
    The way this is done is via an API call.
    Ajax is used to asynchronously make a GET request.
    Upon return the status of the request is checked to see if valid.
